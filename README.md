# Welcome

Clarity Joomla Plugin helps in integarting clarity into your Joomla website easily and seamlessly.

# Clarity

Clarity is an open-source behavioral analytics library written in typescript, with two key goals: privacy & performance.

It helps you understand how users view and use your website across all modern devices and browsers. Understanding how users navigate, interact and browse your website can provide new insights about your users. Empathizing with your users and seeing where features fail or succeed can help improve your product, grow revenue and improve user retention.

It's the same code that powers Microsoft's hosted behavioral analytics solution: <a href="https://clarity.microsoft.com">https://clarity.microsoft.com</a>.
